"""Aging: the per-turn weight update.

This is the piece that makes the weights move on the life of the model rather
than on a calendar. C has just graded a turn. That grade is not only a record -
it is a *signal*, and here it is handed to whatever is running A's weights so
they can take one small step toward what C approved and away from what C
rejected.

Design notes, because the honest ones matter:

* **A must be running on weights we can touch.** A hosted, frozen endpoint
  cannot learn. So the update goes to a configurable endpoint
  (``SAWII_UPDATE_URL``) that a self-hosted server (vLLM + LoRA, or the
  transformers/PEFT wrapper) exposes. When that URL is unset the module is a
  no-op and says so - it never pretends a hosted model learned anything.

* **The signal is C's, not ours.** GREEN reinforces, YELLOW is a nudge away,
  RED is a clear penalty. We do not invent a reward the verifier didn't give.

* **The anchor gates it, exactly like it gates the night.** If C's rehearsal
  says the mind has drifted below the floor, we stop writing to the weights -
  a drifting verifier teaching every turn is how you get a fast, confident
  stranger.

* **One step per turn, and it is slow on purpose.** Aging is not fine-tuning.
  The server owns the learning rate; we only ever ask for one step, and we
  never batch a day's worth into the middle of a conversation.

* **Failures are loud.** A failed update is recorded and reported to the
  subsystems dashboard. The mind keeps talking - but you know the body is
  hurt.
