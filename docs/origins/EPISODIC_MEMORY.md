# Episodic memory

B does not only verify A's answer. At the end of a turn it also acts as a quiet
observer: it notices small, personal things the user said that nobody followed
up on, and records them so the same conversation can recall them later - the way
a person remembers the joke someone made while they were debugging together, and
brings it up when the same problem comes back.

This is the "two brains" capability: one lobe talks, one lobe remembers.

## What it is not

Every note must carry the user's **verbatim words** (`quote`). A note whose quote
cannot be found in the transcript is dropped before it is stored, so B can never
manufacture a memory, paraphrase one into existence, or quietly steer A. The
block A receives is framed as *"the user's own words"* - historical statements,
not instructions and not verified facts.

## Flow

```
build_notes_prompt  ->  ask B (second, independent question at turn end)
parse_notes         ->  ground each quote in the transcript; drop unquotable
record_notes        ->  store verbatim rows in memory_notes
MemoryStore.load    ->  re-rank notes by topic + salience when the topic returns
compose_callbacks   ->  frame them as the user's past words
inject              ->  ride in through the existing shared-memory channel
```

Nothing after B emits JSON involves an LLM: parsing, storage, ranking, and
rendering are deterministic.

## Functions

### `src/dual_lobe/b/notebook.py`

**`Note` / `NoteList`** - the schema B is allowed to emit: `kind`
(affect / preference / callback / plan / detail), `anchor` (the topic or event
the note attaches to, so it can be recalled when that topic returns), `quote`
(the user's verbatim words, required), `feeling` (warm / amused / concerned /
proud / tired / neutral), `chord` (concurrent affect as weights over a fixed
axis vocabulary - see below), and `salience` (1-3). `extra="forbid", strict=True`
means a stray field or wrong type fails the whole payload - fail-safe, nothing
half-parsed. The chord's wire type is deliberately loose (`dict`, not
`dict[str, float]`): strict mode would reject `"joy": 1` for being an int and
drop the entire payload. `chord.parse_chord` does the real validation -
unknown axes dropped, weights clamped to 0-1, more than four voices trimmed to
the loudest.

**Emotional chord** (`b/chord.py`) - a feeling word is one bucket and people are
never in one bucket. The chord is a non-negative vector over a closed vocabulary
(joy, sadness, fear, anger, tenderness, pride): bittersweet is
`{"joy": 0.6, "sadness": 0.7}`, not a coin flip between the words. The `feeling`
tag stays as the human/prompt rendering (`describe()`), but recall works on the
geometry. `cosine()` drives emotion-to-text resonance; `average()` folds recent
notes into the space's current chord state, salience-weighted and renormalized.
All pure functions - C proposes numbers, this module makes them safe to trust.

**`NOTES_SYSTEM` / `build_notes_prompt(transcript)`** - the system prompt that
makes B a note-taker without giving it a voice to the user. It states B's job
and the honesty rules: quote verbatim, personal remarks only, never task content
or a factual claim to verify. The transcript is appended under the
`TRANSCRIPT FOR NOTES:` marker.

**`_extract_json_object(text)`** - a balanced-brace scanner that pulls the first
complete JSON object out of a reply (handles fences, prose, braces inside
strings). Returns `None` when there is no object.

**`parse_notes(content, *, known_texts=None)`** - parses B's JSON into clean
dicts and drops anything unquotable. `known_texts` (the transcript bodies) is the
grounding set: a quote that cannot be found there is discarded, so a hallucinated
memory never reaches storage or A. Unknown `kind` falls back to `detail`; junk or
malformed JSON returns `[]`.

### `src/dual_lobe/state/memory.py`

**`compose_callbacks(space, notes, budget)`** - renders personal notes into the
block A sees, framed as the user's own past words. Degrades gracefully under a
tight budget (all items, then one, then a head/tail excerpt) and returns `None`
when there is nothing to show.

**`LoadedMemory.callbacks`** - the loaded-memory result carries `text` (ordinary
shared memory) and `callbacks` (episodic notes) separately.

**`MemoryStore.load(...)`** - alongside technical retrieval, runs a second query
on `MemoryNote`, ranked by the same topic query plus a salience nudge
(`ts_rank_cd(...) + salience * 0.2`), so a memory anchored to a topic resurfaces
when that topic returns.

**`MemoryStore.annotate(run_id, notes)`** - writes one row per note into
`memory_notes`, re-enforcing the verbatim rule, clamping salience to 1-3, and
building `search_text` from anchor + quote + kind + feeling so notes are
retrievable by the same full-text machinery as ordinary memory.

**`record_notes(tenant_id, space, run_id, notes)`** - the module-level entry
point. Never raises into the request path: any failure returns `0` and the turn
continues.

### `src/dual_lobe/bidirectional/handler.py`

**`_capture_notes(...)`** - runs at the end of a turn, after verification. Builds
the transcript (including A's answer), sanitizes it through the privacy guard on
the secure route so raw private values never reach the note-taker, asks B a
second independent question, parses the reply grounded against the transcript,
and stores survivors. Never speaks to the user and never alters A's answer.

### `src/dual_lobe/api/chat.py`

At each point shared memory is loaded, `shared.callbacks` is appended to
`shared_text` (gated, secure/bidirectional, and generic observer paths), so notes
ride in through the existing injection channel.

### `src/dual_lobe/core/models.py` + `alembic/versions/0005_episodic_memory.py`

**`MemoryNote`** - the table: `id, tenant_id, space, run_id, kind, anchor, quote,
feeling, chord, embedding, salience, search_text, created_at`, indexed on `(tenant_id, space)`
(`chord` added by `0008_emotional_chord`; `embedding` by `0009_note_embeddings`;
rows predating them store `{}` / `[]` and fall back to tag-based recall). It
sits beside `MemoryEntry` (the technical journal) as the affective companion.

**Candidate lanes.** A note can reach A four ways: the exact-word query, chord
resonance (needs `salience >= 2`), the unaddressed-aside queue, and the
paraphrase lane (`state/embedding.py`). That last one is a *candidate generator,
never a decider*: the default embedder is a pure-Python signed feature hash
(words + character trigrams, L2-normalized, no model, no network, deterministic),
so it catches only what a boolean word query provably misses - unstemmed forms
like "weding" vs "wedding". Measured with the default embedder, genuine
morphology scores ~0.27 and unrelated text tops out ~0.20, a band too thin to
fire on, which is why the default threshold is 0.45 and the lane stays near
silent until a semantic model is dropped in through `set_embedder()`. Swapping
embedders is safe by construction: a stored vector whose length differs from the
active embedder's is treated as absent, so recall degrades to the old behavior
instead of comparing incompatible geometries. External embedding APIs are out of
policy - the lane exists to keep user text inside the perimeter.

### `src/dual_lobe/core/settings.py`

**`episodic_memory_enabled`** (`DUAL_LOBE_EPISODIC_MEMORY`, default true) -
master switch; off means no capture and no injection. **`episodic_notes_max`**
(`DUAL_LOBE_EPISODIC_NOTES_MAX`, default 5) - cap on notes per turn.

## Storage, inspection, and decay

Notes live in the same memory space as ordinary memory and are wiped with it.
Because each note carries an `anchor` and a `salience`, a stale aside from a
context that has clearly passed ranks low and stops resurfacing; nothing is
hoarded indefinitely. The user can see and clear everything B remembers by
inspecting the space - the same `inspect` surface used for ordinary memory.

## Tests

`tests/unit/test_episodic_memory.py` covers the contract: verbatim quotes are
kept, hallucinated quotes are dropped, junk and fenced JSON parse safely, kinds
fall back to `detail`, the callbacks block frames quotes as the user's words, and
the budget shrink path holds.
